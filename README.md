		<h1># Proyecto1</h1>
           <p>First proyect in order to practice what I`ve learned</p>
      
      <h2># Presentation</h2>
           <p>Hi, my name is Patricio and I`m a student in this wonderful world that`s call I.T </p>
      
      <h2># Proyect Objective</h2>
           <p>In order to practice what i have learned, I create a program that insert an employee of a company in the database. 
              It`s a ConsoleApp coding in C# whith OPP.</p>
      
      <h2># Content</h2>
           <p>The employee would have a MENU with five options to operate with. Before the log in part wich is very simple. </p>
      <ul>
         <li> Is to add the new person into the Database with a file number on it. That number would become the one and only id and that               is how the company will identify him/her.</li>
         <li> Erase the File if, for some reason you need to do it again, you can... just erase it and that`s it. Start again.</li>
         <li>You can search the file to see what data did you write for the person, and also modify if you find any mistake on it. </li>
         <li>You can see three lists. The definitive person created (with the file), only the person (without the file), and only the                files. ¿Why three lists? Simply because I can and I wanted to show you how I manage the object List.</li>
         <li>Statistic of what you are entering. I think every program have a minimum of short statistics, it`s nice, it helps, I like                it.            </li>
         <li>Save and load data. This is very important, you can save your work, turn off the computer and turn on the next day with the             information still in the system. ¿How? Because, when you saved it, all the information will be stored in a repository that               is linked in the code (an XML file). Tomorrow you will have to go to number five and recovered what you have done if you                 want to see all the information loaded.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2># Things To Consider </h2>
      <ul>
         <li> The architecture: I didn´t pay attention to that. It wasn´t my intention to make a nice proyect in the folder organization               or the elements display. That would be an ASP.NET MVC proyect (and it will be my next move, not this one).</li>
         <li> No Exceptions: It´s simply because an exception will stop my entire program once it happens, so I only put simple                       validations to show you that i can do it.</li>
         <li> Challenge: I know what you are going to say; "This could be much easier if you just..." Yes, it probably would... but the               things is, i wanted to be that rought. Becouse this proyect means that i can fit in a problem and work it out. I wanted to               be problematic and see how i manage to pull this off. </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2># Conclusion </h2>
  
         <p> It`s a very intuitive program where you can`t get lost. Easy, quick and put every part of my brain to the test.    
             I have a lot of fun doing it. I`m proud. Is not perfect but it has the time and dedication I could possibly give.  
             I learn so much in the practice and i will continue with this sort of selfthought method. 
             I hope you like it and i`m open for suggestion. I`m a student so every comment will be most appreciate.
