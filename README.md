Proyect1
First proyect in order to practice what I`ve learned

Presentation
Hi, my name is Patricio and Im a student in this wonderful world thats call I.T

Proyect Objective
In order to practice what i have learned, I create a program that insert an employee of a company in the database. It`s a ConsoleApp coding in C# whith OPP.

Content
The employee would have a MENU with five options to operate with. Before the log in part wich is very simple.

1- Is to add the new person into the Database with a file number on it. That number would become the one and only id and that is how the company will identify him/her.

2- Erase the File if, for some reason you need to upload the person again, you can... just erase it and that`s it. Start again.

3- You can search the file to see what data did you write for the person, and also modify if you find any mistake on it.

4- There are three lists. The definitive person (with the file), only the person (without the file), and only the files. ¿Why three lists? Simply because I can and I wanted to show you how I manage the object "List".

5- Statistic of what data you are entering. I think every program have a minimum of short statistics, it`s nice, it helps, I like it.

6- Save and load data. This is very important. You can save your work by turning off the computer and turning on the next day with the information still in the system. ¿How? Because, when you saved it, all the information will be stored in a repository that is linked in the code (an XML file). Tomorrow you will have to set number five on the MENU and recovered what you have done if you want to see all the information loaded.

Things To Consider
The architecture: I didn´t pay attention to that. It wasn´t my intention to make a nice proyect in the folder organization or the elements display. That would be an ASP.NET MVC proyect (and it will be my next step, not this one).
No Exceptions: It´s simply because an exception will stop my entire program once it happens, so I only put simple validations to show you that i can do it.
Challenge: I know what you are going to say; "This could be much easier if you just..." Yes, it probably would... but the things is, i wanted to be that rought. Becouse this proyect means that i can face any problem and work it out. I wanted to be problematic and see how i manage to pull this off.
Conclusion
Its a very intuitive program where you cant get lost. Easy, quick and put every part of my brain to the test.
I have a lot of fun doing it. Im proud. Is not perfect, a little messy but it has the time and dedication I could possibly give. I learn so much in the practice and i will continue with this sort of selfthought method. I hope you like it and im open for suggestion. I`m a student so every comment will be most appreciate.

Thank you for your time.

Patricio.
